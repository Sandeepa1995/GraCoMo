# GraCoMo
A cost model for GraphIt algorithms.

## To run
- Run main2.py (Some sections may be commented). This would,
  - Generate the graphs using R-MAT (Requires PaRMAT)
  - Generate the object files for the algorithm and schedule
  - Run the graphs on the schedules (this is done parallely)
- In the Python Notebook files you will find the models
  - XGBoost has the model that gives the best result
